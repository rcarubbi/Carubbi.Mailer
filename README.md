# Carubbi.Mailer
A simple library to handle email sending and receiving tasks

> Is an abstraction to different approaches to send and receive emails
> You can send emails by SMTP, Exchange WebService or Outlook 2007 and 2010 interop
> You can receive emails by POP3 (OpenPOP), Exchange WebService, or Outlook 2007 and 2010 interop
> The implementations can be injected one you have a unique interface for sender and receiver. 
> In Carubbi.ServiceLocator you will find a Service Locator Anti-Pattern implementation to simplify this injection. (Is not the best way to do that but works, other better options could be StructureMap, Ninject, or AutoFac)
